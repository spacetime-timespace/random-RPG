Simple version:
Hello. What we have made you is a thing where you can be a person and move around and do other kinds of stuff. We have also made other games. For some reason, people want us to 
have some writing so they can know if we allow them to make it again and call it something else and share it with other people in the entire world. I think everyone should be 
able to make it again, but some other people like those who write some books and make people pay to get them think that not all people should be able to make it again, since if
they were allowed just to make it again, someone would make the book again and then no one would have to pay to get it so the book writer would have no more money left and that
would be bad for the book writer. To fix this, the book writer asks the important people of the country to do something about it, so then if you make it again, and those people 
find out, than bad things will happen to you. However, some people make stuff and they allow anyone to make it again. To tell if the person lets you make it again, they made 
this writing. For some reason, people have made some different sets of writing that tell you if you're allowed to make it again or not, and everyone wants us to use one of those 
sets, because they have short but bad names that don't even tell you anything about the set of writing, but everyone knows them by their name anyways. The sets of writing are 
usually very strange and hard to understand, so by making this extra writing, I am making it easier for you. 

The set of writing that we are using just means that if something bad happens to you because of the thing that we made you, you can't say we are bad. It's like pretending that 
you just found it on a card outside. Also, you can make it again if you want, and any part of it, but you have to also put this writing in there so other people know what they
have to do if they want to make it again.

Hello. I understand that you are a human and do not know what all those words meant. It means that no one can look at this and say that we are bad since we made this, and you can do whatever you want with it as long as you keep this writing that tells everyone how they can do stuff with these things.
