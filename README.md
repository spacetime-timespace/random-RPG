# random-project

This is just something we decided to make to practice the python library arcade. Currently, the main.py contains the only functional "game" we have. RPG.py has implemented movement, but isn't able to run directly.

Instructions for running RPG.py:

If you live in a place with normal download speed, download Tileset-parsed.zip and unzip it. RPG.py will run just fine. For places with slower download speed, you might want to download Tileset instead, along with parser.py. If you run parser.py, you will get Tileset-parsed without having to download it.

(Same thing for Fonts.zip, Fonts-parsed.zip, and parser (font).py. Dusk Fonts.zip is just for anyone who wants to use the fonts in text files)

Also, remember to install arcade, random, pillow, and numpy.
