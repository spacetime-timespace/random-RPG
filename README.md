# random-project

This is just something we decided to make to practice the python library arcade. Currently, the main.py contains the only functional "game" we have. RPG.py has implemented movement, but due to the sheer amount of files in it, we haven't been able to upload Tileset-parsed yet, and it won't work without the texture pack.
