# random-project

This is just something we decided to make to practice the python library arcade. Currently, the main.py contains the only functional "game" we have. RPG.py has implemented movement, but isn't able to run directly.

Instructions for running RPG.py:

1. Go to releases -> 2.0 -> download as zip
2. Unzip it.
3. Install requirements.txt
4. Run RPG.py
